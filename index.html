        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Pokemon is a video game in which you can catch hatch get gifts and battle pokemon you can also in gen 7 can clean your pokemon up after a battle to start I suggest with pokemon red, blue and yellow which are called gen 1 because they are the first generation then go to higher gens. Poketuber are people who post pokemon videos on youtube pokemon websites are places where you can reasearch pokemon. ROMs are read only memories and they can be used through emulators which emulate the game on PC or mobile device. Beta Pokemon are are pokemon that were thought of but were declined. </p>

        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>To play Pokemon on emulators you need to have a rom which you can get from RoyalRom.com and you need to have the correct emulator so if you have a gameboy game hten you need the myoldboy gbc emulator which you can get from the google app store. You can see which device the game was on by looking at the left side of the game. This is a list of all emulators you can play on without lag: MyOldBoy GBC Emulator for gameboy and gameboy color, MyBoy GBA Emulator for gameboy advance. </p>
